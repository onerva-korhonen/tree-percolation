A script for writing the empirical vulnerability curve of Betula pendula (from Gonz치lez-Mu침oz et al. 2018, PLOS ONE 13: e0196075)
in a format readable by percolation.read_and_combine_spreading_probability_optimization_data. The data used here
is obtained by averaging the sigmoidal fits to the vulnerability curves from the four populations considered by Gonz치les-Mu침oz et al.
